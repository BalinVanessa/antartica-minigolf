# Antarctic Adventure
### *Brave the cold to hatch your penguin egg.*

Explore Antarctica’s vibrant wildlife in this mini-mini golf hole. You’ll experience the life of a penguin trying to protect its egg while bringing it to safety. Keep a sharp eye out for the predatory seals and orcas that’ll try to steal your child. 

The icy structures of the arctic will be a rough terrain to navigate, as you swim through freezing water, slide down glaciers, and climb up snowy hills. 

Once the egg is back safely in its nest, it’ll need warmth to grow. Nurture your egg and watch it hatch!
